Lab 03 Part-2: https://classroom.github.com/a/p8TgQWwF 
Reflection: Lab 03, part 2 was a really interesting code to write as it was short. This time around we had to write in units of the metric system and
create equations to convert them. Even if they were simple equations, creating something similar to a calculator was still interesting. 


Lab 08 Part-3: https://classroom.github.com/a/BelWwaSt 
Reflection: Lab 8, part 3 was a favorite of mine as we got to code in an animation. This part of the code was different than the rest as we had
to read files to check for spelling or write secret messages. This time we had files with the animations in them and we had to find out how to make our code read them.


Lab 10 Part-3: https://classroom.github.com/a/clEPlHvX 
Reflection: Lab 10, part 3 was challenging as the entire lab wrote multiple codes for one part. The last part was when we were introduced
to the Magick library to create our first image using RGB. This gave us the freedom to create any kind of image we wanted as we learned more about 
how we control the lights on RGB (Red, Green, Blue).
